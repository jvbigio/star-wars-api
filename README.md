# Summary

This was my first React application and also the first time fetching data from an API. That said, it was an awesome and challenging experience. For example, learning React library while also building a project created various roadblocks that I needed to tackle when it came to using components and manipulating the data from the API.

React is amazing! I look forward to gaining deeper insight on how to harness its full potential!
